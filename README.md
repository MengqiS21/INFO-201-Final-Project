# Summary
Based on our analyzation of the data we have noticed that:

1. The number of pet licenses has drastically increased over the years, and dog's owner are much higher than cat's owner.
2. By the year trends, It shows a clearly increases of the number of pet registration. This can be seen that more and more people are aware of the importance of pet registration, it is beneficial to every person, whether have or have no pet. It provides a better chance of being returned home if lost, and it is a prof that the pet has properly vaccinated which reassure others.
3. By the month trends, it illustrates an overall view on how many people register for pet license each month. Most people have their pet license during October - December There are least people in September It can help pet owners better schedule their appointments to government agencies to register their pet license and avoid the peak time. from the plot, it is better for people go to register their pet license during June or September.
4. From the pet name worldcloud, we found the patterns of pets name for dog/cat. 'Lucy', 'Charlie', 'Bella', 'Luna', 'Oliver' and 'Max' seem to be shared names for dogs and cats. However, 'Buddy' and 'Sadie' seem to only work for dogs.
5. Since our data was found on the Seattle open data website, our data quality is reliable and unbiased. The data is reporting every pet in Seattle area. We didn't see any issues that will potentially harm certain population groups, we think this dataset could provide benefit ideas to those people want to have pets.
6. The future idea we could do to advance this Seattle pet licenses app is spreading this app to different areas, and clear the importance of pet licenses, what can pet license do for us, especially those pet lovers.
